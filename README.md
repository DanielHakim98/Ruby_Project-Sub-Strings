# Ruby_Project-Sub-Strings
* Second basic ruby project. It'll find the word that you want to find and return it for you.
* In a programming-like language, it'll the 'key' the user gives, find it in a array, and then return it in form of hash with key/value pair.

* I couldn't solve it by myself. So I admit, I rewrite the code from 'nguyenjessev' on his github account and then I try to understand each code of line methods and what it does and lastly, I modified and replicate into my own way of doing it.
* Right now, I'm still working on it. I'll redo it again by my own way.
* Oh btw, I learn new method called 'scan' which basically check if an array contains a string or regex argument from 'scan' and the method will return an array with scanned elements.
